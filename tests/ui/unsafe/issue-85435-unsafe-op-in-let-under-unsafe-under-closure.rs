// This is issue #85435. But the real story is reflected in issue #85561, where
// a bug in the implementation of feature(capture_disjoint_fields) () was
// exposed to non-feature-gated code by a diagnostic changing PR that removed
// the gating in one case.

// This test is double-checking that the case of interest continues to work as
// expected in the *absence* of that feature gate. At the time of this writing,
// enabling the feature gate will cause this test to fail. We obviously cannot
// stabilize that feature until it can correctly handle this test.
