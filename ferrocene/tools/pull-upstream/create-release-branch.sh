# This script creates the base branch for each rolling release channel (which
# corresponds to the upstream stable channel) by looking at the version of the
# provided upstream ref (like "stable" or "beta") and creating the branch with
# the last Ferrocene commit of that version.
#
# Note that the last Ferrocene commit of that version might be behind the last
# upstream commit of that version: upstream takes care not to rollup version
# bumps with other changes, while we don't do that during our regular pulls
# from upstream. That's not a problem though, as any followup pull from
# upstream on the newly created branch will bring Ferrocene on par.
